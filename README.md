# Plasmonic lattice simulations

Simulating Green's function interactions in plasmonic lattices.

## TODO
- [ ] Implement convergence results for lattice sums
- [x] Complex root solver

   Kind of done for the square case, needs including in main code

- [ ] Better complex root solver

   Is there a better method than recasting the problem from C^2 to R^4?

- [ ] Multiprocessing for lattice sums

   Currently using multiprocessing to loop over frequency and reciprocal space for extinction plots

- [x] Create single file which can be used with many lattices

   Done (kind of)

## Other TODO
- [ ] Clean up code

   Need to rename files

- [ ] Documentation

   Better commenting and actual documentation!
